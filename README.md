# family-mcp

Local MCP servers provide Abler sports schedules and messages, an Icelandic InfoMentor school
account, Inna school accounts, a Krónan grocery account, and Domino’s Iceland ordering. Each release
is a standalone native executable, so the MCP host does not need Node, npm, or Bun
at runtime.

Visit [mcp.olinn.is](https://mcp.olinn.is) for a short introduction and installers
in English and Icelandic.

## Abler

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/olafurns7/family-mcp/abler-mcp@0.6.0/packages/abler-mcp/install.sh | sh
```

Upgrading replaces the command but not a running server; restart the MCP host, or
rerun with `--stop-running`.

```sh
abler-mcp auth login
```

Expected output: `Sign in to Abler in the browser window that opened.`

Tools: [session, children, timetables, messages, notifications, and scheduled updates](packages/infomentor-mcp/README.md#mcp-tools).

Flags (`--allow-setup-tools`, `--allow-account-change`), file locations, and troubleshooting: see [packages/infomentor-mcp/README.md](packages/infomentor-mcp/README.md).

Grok Bot connectivity: add `--with-direct-route` to the installer command to
verify and save the tested alternate InfoMentor route on Linux. It requires
Python 3 and administrator access. See the
[setup instructions](packages/infomentor-mcp/docs/CONNECTIVITY.md#reproduce-on-another-grok-vm).
WARP is currently unreliable on the tested Grok route; see the
[remote-machine guidance](packages/infomentor-mcp/README.md#remote-machines-and-warp).

## Inna

Install the preview and start electronic-ID login:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/olafurns7/family-mcp/inna-mcp@0.3.0/packages/inna-mcp/install.sh | sh
inna-mcp auth login
```

Enter the phone number at the hidden prompt and match the displayed security
code before approving on the phone. An agent running this login must always
show that exact code to the user. Enter the electronic-ID PIN only on the phone.

To sign in with a Google account linked in Inna instead, run
`inna-mcp auth login --google` on a machine with a desktop and Chrome or
Chromium, and sign in in the window that opens. The session is saved and the
window closes by itself; no cookies or passwords are copied, and an agent never
asks for them. This requires a release after Inna 0.2.2.

Configure the MCP host to run the absolute path to `~/.local/bin/inna-mcp` with
`serve`. For Claude Code:

```sh
claude mcp add inna -- /absolute/path/to/.local/bin/inna-mcp serve
```

Read tools are enabled by default; whole-day illness and leave requests
require `--allow-absence-writes`, a prepared preview, and explicit approval.
Live absence submission remains unverified.

See [setup, tools, and cookie import for a machine without a desktop](packages/inna-mcp/README.md).

## Krónan

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/olafurns7/family-mcp/kronan-mcp@0.2.0/packages/kronan-mcp/install.sh | sh
```

Upgrading replaces the command but not a running server; restart the MCP host, or
rerun with `--stop-running`.

```sh
kronan-mcp auth set
```

Expected output: `Krónan access token verified and saved:`

<details>
<summary>Connect to Claude Desktop, Claude Code, or Codex</summary>

**Claude Desktop**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "kronan": {
      "command": "/absolute/path/to/.local/bin/kronan-mcp",
      "args": ["serve"],
      "env": {
        "KRONAN_TOKEN_FILE": "/absolute/path/kronan-token.json"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Claude Code**

```sh
claude mcp add kronan -e KRONAN_TOKEN_FILE=/absolute/path/kronan-token.json -- /absolute/path/to/.local/bin/kronan-mcp serve
```

**Codex**

```toml
[mcp_servers.kronan]
command = "/absolute/path/to/.local/bin/kronan-mcp"
args = ["serve"]
env = { KRONAN_TOKEN_FILE = "/absolute/path/kronan-token.json" }
```

</details>

Tools: [products, recipes, orders, purchase history, shopping notes, delivery and pickup slots, and checkout](packages/kronan-mcp/README.md#tools).

The server can also edit the shopping note and the basket, and place and change
orders. Order tools can authorize a charge on the saved card with no further
verification step, so each needs explicit confirmation of the checkout and its
total. Fees and the delivery slot can make the authorized amount higher than that
total. Each approval allows one attempt; `kronan-mcp orders clear-attempts` clears
the local record after you check your Krónan orders. The write tools are not yet
verified against a live Krónan account; read
[Ordering and payment](packages/kronan-mcp/README.md#ordering-and-payment) first.

Token setup, file locations, and troubleshooting: see [packages/kronan-mcp/README.md](packages/kronan-mcp/README.md).

## Dominos

Install the preview release:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/olafurns7/family-mcp/dominos-mcp@0.1.0/packages/dominos-mcp/install.sh | sh
dominos-mcp auth login
```

Configure the MCP host to run the absolute path to `~/.local/bin/dominos-mcp` with `serve`.
For Claude Code:

```sh
claude mcp add dominos -- /absolute/path/to/.local/bin/dominos-mcp serve
```

See [setup, tools, and payment behavior](packages/dominos-mcp/README.md).
Live login, refresh, account reads, quotes, and unpaid saved-card retrieval have
been verified. Charging remains untested; bank-verification continuation is not
implemented. Payment requires explicit approval of the exact order, total, and card.

## Security

Credentials and authentication secrets—including passwords, cookies, refresh
tokens, and private credential-file contents—are never returned as MCP tool
output. Keep session and credential files private to the host user.

Family and shopping data **is returned to the configured MCP host**. That can
include child identities, schedules, messages, notifications, purchase history,
orders, delivery addresses, and shopping notes, so only connect hosts and
data-processing providers that you trust with that data. Abler and InfoMentor
expose read paths; InfoMentor's opt-in setup tools only manage the local session and do
not edit school records. Krónan also edits the shopping note and basket, and can
place and change orders on the saved card after explicit confirmation. The Krónan
token is a personal API credential and must remain private to the host user.
Domino’s also creates unpaid orders and can charge a saved card after explicit
confirmation. Its outputs include masked card metadata.

## For agents and contributors

Using these servers from an agent? Each section above is self-contained; tool schemas are strict and documented in the package READMEs.

Working on this repo with a coding agent? Read [docs/AGENTS.md](docs/AGENTS.md) and [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md).

## Development

```sh
bun install
bun run check
bun run test
```

See [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) for the full gate.
