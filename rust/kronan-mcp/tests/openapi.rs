//! Krónan's OpenAPI document is pinned by packages/kronan-mcp/api/openapi.sha256, and the
//! TypeScript `api:check` and api-types.test.ts gate the TypeScript schemas against it. The Rust
//! request and response shapes are written by hand, so they are pinned to the same hash: when
//! the document changes, this fails until they are revisited and the hash below is updated.

/// names built from it, which follow schemas.ts's inputs), src/shapes.rs (the upstream response
/// shapes, which follow schemas.ts's upstream and output schemas), and the endpoint paths and
/// methods in src/api.rs.
